            One of my many hobbies is traveling, I love seeing and experiencing new things especially when I get to do it with my family. My parents
            are originally from India so when we go there often we always make sure to go on amazing family trips. And in the US I've been to many states
            going on road trips with my family. I've also been to Canada, Switzerland and a short layover in China too! Here I'll be sharing some easy but
            super fun destinations, what I did, what I enjoyed about them and some tips!
        </p>

            <h4>Natural Bridge</h4>
            My family and I went to this place after being bored in quarantine for a while, we woke up around 5am and my mom prepared a picnic for us.
            We wanted to get there early before it got too hot, remember be safe when hiking in AZ summers. But we got lucky that day becuase the temperature
            capped out at 80 degrees. First we went down this little trail that led us to the small waterfall shown in the video, this didn't take us that long but
            we were already hungry, so we had a nice picnic and then went to explore a bit more. When we went there we didn't realize that the trail circled around.
            So at first we went 2/3 of the way though turned around and then found the rest of the 1/3 the opposite way! If you plan to come here be sure to wear
            good sneakers (not white ones like me!), plan for the heat if you go in summer and make sure to do the trail as a loop!

            <h4>Camel Rock</h4>
            My family and I went to Camel Rock on a road trip from NY to Texas. It's located in Illinois and while it may not be the most obvious it get's it's name
            from the shape of the rock formation that can be seen in the video. I'd say it's quite similar to the camel rock in AZ but the camel here is a bit
            more prominent. The hike here was fairly steep but very well paved and not too lengthy so I would consider it an easy trail. The path on the way there
            is lined with lots of trees so there is lots of shade, so even in the middle of a summer day a hike here is not bad at all! If you plan to come here
            make sure to remember you're way in, because we got lost on the road and there was no signal for a bit.

            <h4>Caverns</h4>
            My family and I went to the Caverns on the same road trip from NY to Texas. And I would say that this was definetly one of my favorite places we visted
            because of how unique the expereince was to me. The caverns are basically under ground caves that have these beautiful formations from the dampness of
            the cave. Here we took a guided tour through the cave where the tour guided explained how the place was discovered and presereved, it's all natural, so 
            no touching! The tour also took us on a small boat ride, which was super exciting, a boat ride in a cave?! I would 10/10 recomend this expereince. If
            you plan on going, try to go in the spring when it's not too hot, make sure to wear sneakers because it can be quite slipery and bring a good camera, 
            it's a bit dark but you'll definetly want pictures!

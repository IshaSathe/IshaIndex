                        This is one of the stories that I tell all the time. While it may not seem the funniest at first it's pretty for me
                        to look back at. So, in 2nd grade we had some extra recess time and so my teacher thought we'd play sharks and minos and so while
                        running back and fourth I somehow tripped which is still a mystery because I was wearing velcro sneakers becuase I didnt know
                        how to tie my shoes! And when I got taken to the nurse I didn't tell her how bad it hurt and she just assumed it was a scape so
                        when I came in the next day with a cast everyone was so confused. Looking back at it, I laugh about how shy I was that I couldn't
                        tell the nurse that my arm was broken!!

                    <p class="notefont">
                        If you read the about me, you know that I'm pretty much a nerd which meant I loved the teachnology classes in
                        highschool. But it turned out that I was the only one who felt this way. The first tech class that I took in highschool I was the only
                        girl and this pattern continued throughout highschool. But beging me, I didn't let this deter me, a friend and I decided to make a tech
                        club for women and it was a mini sucess! So being the only girl wasn't the most fun but something really cool came out of it!

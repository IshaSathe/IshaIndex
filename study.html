                                    For this craft we'll be creating a personalized planner using left over school suplies. So grab an leftover notebook and get ready to
                                    repurpose
                                </li>
                                <li>Then visit <a href="https://daydesigner.com/collections/printable-library">Day Designer</a> to pick out a style of planner that you like</li>
                                <li>Print the design but make sure to only print the page's you need and to the right size, if you don't have a color printer don't worry, our next step is customization!</li>
                                <li>
                                    Now we'll take the printout and paste them into the notebook. Personally I like to add a calender to one side of the notebook and then the other
                                    side can consist of a mini checklist/todo for the month/week.
                                </li>
                                <li>Now just customize! Make it colorful, add your schedule, and use it to keep your activities organized!</li>
                                <li>Go study!</li>
                            </ol>

                                    For this craft we will be creating a pencil pounch by repurposing again! So first things first, grab that old shirt or pair of jeans
                                    or any cloth laying around that you want to make use of. Make sure it's a patern you like because this will be your pencil pouch pattern
                                </li>
                                <li>Cut the fabric into two pieces in the shape you'd like the pencil pounch to have</li>
                                <li>Take about a yard if thread and thread it through your needle, take the zipper and sow each side onto each piece of fabric</li>
                                <li>Once the zippers have been sowed on, zip the zipper, this will ensure that we sow the rest straight</li>
                                <li>Before sowing the rest together make sure the zipper is inside out, sow the pieces together and turn it inside out.</li>
                                <li>Now you can add other fabric patches or sow on some beads</li>
                                <li>Go study!</li>
                            </ol>
